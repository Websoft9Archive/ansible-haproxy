## Ports

You can control(open or shut down) ports by **[Security Group Setting](https://support.websoft9.com/docs/faq/zh/tech-instance.html)** of your Cloud Server whether the port can be accessed from Internet.

You can run the cmd `netstat -tunlp` to list all used ports, and we list the following most useful ports for you:

| Name | Number | Use |  Necessity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP | 8161 | HTTP requests for HAProxy Console| Required |
| HTTPS | 5672 | epmd | Optional |
| TCP | 55672 | Erlang distribution | Optional |


## Version

You can see the version from product page of Marketplace. However, after being deployed to your server, the components will be automatically updated, resulting in a certain change in the version number. Therefore, the exact version number should be viewed by running the command on the server:

```shell
# Check all components version
sudo cat /data/logs/install_version.txt

# Linux Version
lsb_release -a

# Nginx  Version
nginx -V

# Java version
java -v

# Docker Version
docker -v

# erlang  Version
yum info erlang
apt show erlang

# HAProxy version
haproxyctl status | grep HAProxy*
```
